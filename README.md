# Encrypted Signal

FrontEnd Implementation for Secure Programming Project - Encrypted Signal - An Encrypted File Sharing Platform! Users can upload a file, share that file with another registered user. This application follows Secure Programming and covers some of the OWASP Top 10 Web Application Security Risks. A detailed project report can be found here: [Encrypted Signal - Secure Programming Report](https://github.com/TUNI-Projects/Encrypted-Signal-Backend/blob/master/report/Encrypted%20Signal%20-%20Secure%20Programming%20Report.pdf).

## Features

* User Registration, Login, Logout
* User File Upload, Download, Share and Delete

Only owner can share file with other users as well as delete the file.

## OWASP Top 10 Checklist

1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
5. Identification and Authentication Failures
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

I am confident that I have managed to cross these checklist on this project. However, they are in extremely primal level. They require a lot of fine tuning, in different layers, not only on application layer.

## Deployment

The Project is visible in a limited capacity on this website (https://tuni-projects.github.io/Encrypted-Signal/).

Limitations are -

* User Session is valid for 1 minute.
* File Upload Limit is 1 KB.

Localhost implementation won't have this limitation.

### How to Deploy

* `npm install` to install all the node dependencies.
* `npm start` to run the app in the development mode in localhost.
* `npm run deploy` to deploy the app in the github pages.

Thank you
